JIRQANIMO is a web application that provides users with a dashboard to track the progress of stories and bugs. The dashboard includes stats on opened stories, closed stories, not fixed bugs, leaked bugs, SEO bugs, UI bugs, functional bugs and translation bugs. It also includes two graphs to show the progress of opened and closed stories per day.

The application is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The style sheet is located in the "style.css" file and the main script is located in the "main.js" file.
